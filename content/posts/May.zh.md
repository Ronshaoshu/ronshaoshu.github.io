title = 'Why May?'
+++

Tons of my friends wondered that why I finally use "May" as my English name. This may help.

I was born in May. 

I embraced most of my precious here. The former, best me in my still short life, always bloomed in Mays. It contains my never-to-forget memories with my beloved family, friends, and me-in-the-past.  

It means a lot to the past, current, and future me. 

That is the hope that, I can always see that kind of me, so do you.

May is always beautiful. Hope you like it.

五月总是美好的, 不是吗?
